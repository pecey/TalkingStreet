                    We’re looking for like-minded, street food enthusiasts to be a part of the ‘Street Food Club’ – an exclusive club of individuals who meet the following requirements. Check if you belong here:

            1. You have participated in golgappa/puchka/pani-puri-eating competitions (a la Rab ne Bana Di Jodi) at your favourite golgappa corner.

            2. The count of lunches / dinners skipped and blamed on street food is in 3 digits.

            3. You’re known to stuff your face with the street food you love, long after you should have stopped eating.

            Club members will have the opportunity to share their street food escapades (thereby legitimizing every lunch/dinner skipped) with a brief description, menu and food images, and a location plot. Depending on interest at both ends, we could follow that up with Street Food Walks which the Club members lead, introducing other enthusiasts to their chosen street food trails.
            Interested? We’re waiting to hear from you.

            Write in to us at hello@talkingstreet.in telling us why you would like to be part of the Street Food Club at Talking Street and which part of the city you would like to cover.

            (P.S. Ability to handle a camera is a necessary condition. Images are a key component of each Talking Street post.)
